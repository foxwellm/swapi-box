# SWAPI-Box
SWAPI-Box is an app created with react that pulls data from the Starwars API (https://swapi.co/api). The main learning goals from this project were to utilize async/await to pull from multiple levels of the api to display the desired data. Use proper data down/ actions up passing props and utilizing state without the use of Redux.
